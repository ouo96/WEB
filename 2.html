<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The origin of the word galaxy derives from the Greek term for the Milky Way, galaxias (γαλαξίας, "milky one"),
  or kyklos galaktikos ("milky circle")due to its appearance as a "milky" band of light in the sky.
  In Greek mythology, Zeus places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles,
   on Hera's breast while she is asleep so that the baby will drink her divine milk and will thus become immortal.
    Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away,
    some of her milk spills, and it produces the faint band of light known as the Milky Way.</p>
