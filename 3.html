<h2>Milky Way</h2>
<p>The Greek philosopher Democritus (450–370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.
  Aristotle (384–322 BCE), however, believed the Milky Way to be caused by "the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large,
  numerous and close together" and that the "ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere,
   in the region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions."
   The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c. 495–570 CE) was critical of this view,
    arguing that if the Milky Way is sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon) it should appear different at different times and places on Earth,
     and that it should have parallax, which it does not. In his view, the Milky Way is celestial.</p>
